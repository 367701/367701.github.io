      <p>The first session i had this week was Computer and Network Systems, as the first session, usally assigned to Software Design and Modelling was used as an introduction for the course. During my Networking session we went of the basic of a PC, including the internal components of a computer system, one things emphasised within this session was the form factor of a PC. The next session I had was Dynamic website, where we went over the basics of a web page, and learnt some interesting facts including who Tim Berners-lee is and what he's accomplished. On Wednesday, we had our first Programming session which introduced algorithms and pseudocode, and we were also introduced to C#. In maths we went through the Maths introduction presentation and also began to work on the module handbook. and then in the afternoon we started to research into blogs and wiki's, we were then tasked to create one for the year.</p>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>This week in Software Design a Modelling we learnt about the System life cycle in the terms of software design, this including different type of modelling, including the waterfall model, Spiral model, and the RAD model. The basic life cycle includes the steps: Planning, defiing, designing, building, testing, and deployment. During network we continued to look at PCs in particular the internal components and justifying why we'd choose a specific component based on its attributes. In web we had our first due date, this consisted of some group work from me and James, the submission was a requirements list for our first full website assignment. This week in programming we continued on with psedocode and also introducted the different type of application that we can make with c# including console based application and windows form applications. In maths we leart, or re-learnt in this case BIDMAS, which is a rule you follow when performing calculations. In our flipped learning lesson we had to discuss the different types of social networking and also cloud storage solutions that we could use to share work between our groups. The majority of people chose Dropbox.</p>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>In software design and modelling this week, we looked at flow charts and how to create them, this will build up a series of diagrams used for a group project for this module. A flow diagram just shows the flow of information within a system. In networking we covered input and output devices, which was covered in my previous course so it was a nice refresher. In web we went over how web pages are operated including HTML, CSS, PHP and the type of connection between the client and server through HTTP, we also learnt about DNS servers and domain names. In programming we went over how to declare different variable types and the different operators. We then created an application to work out the area of a rectangle based on input parameters. In maths we went over scientific notation where large numbers are "shorted", we also went of powers and indices. In business skills we set out to create a personal development plan, a link to that is here <!-- pdp here --></p>

      <p>The software design and modelling session was talking about our first assignment and going of the case study that was provided explaining the current system and the requirements of the new system. In networks we went over the proper lab procedures and where all tools and equipment is located within the room, we then did a computer disassembly that will be used within the first networking assignment. Our website session was finishing our mini submission for initial and final logo designs for the website we will be creating. During programming on Wednesday we investigated the different type of controls that can be used on a windows form application. In maths we went over conversion of denary to binary numbers and also binary arithmetic including adding binary numbers together. In business skills we talked about the different type of people in a team and what makes an effective team.</p>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>In software modelling we went over creating a data flow diagram, to do this we watched a video on the vle and began creating the diagram for our assignment. In networking we disassembled the computers again and re-assembled them taking pictures during each step for our assignment. In web we went over the different types of markup languages inclduing Xml and Html, this included others like XHtml, and then performed some HTML practical activities. In programming we went over Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and its "features" and also C# classes. In maths we continued with binary arithmetic including the subtracting of two binary numbers and also briefely went over hexodecimal values. In business studies we went over how to take meeting minutes, at the end of the session we concluded that by using text chat we could in-a-way log meeting without any extra effort.</p>

      <p>On monday we had a software hand-in regarding some of the diagrams and documentation for our assignment, this was just a checkup submission to make sure everyone is on track, in included the context diagram, information flow diagram, and level 1 and 2 data flow diagrams. During this network session I was rebuilding a PC, this is because I accidentally deleted my evidence for doing this last week and was unable to recover the pictures, the rest of the class were working on the documentation for the Networking assignment. In web technologies we had a mini submission for the colour paleetes for our website, during this session me and James looked over the submission and made some improvements and then continued to work on the assignment. In programming we went over while loops and an example of a swtich statement we then created a converting program to convert numbers into different bases. In maths we recieved our first maths assignment hand out, throughout this session i began working on this assignment. In business skills we went over the method of fact finding, including questionaires and also looked into prezi.</p>

      <p>On Monday we handed in a set of two diagrams for the software design and modelling module, consisting of two levels of physical data flow diagrams, we completed these within the session with appropriate documentation. In the networking session this week we upgraded a computer by inserting a new graphics processing unit (GPU) within the system, this will go towards our assignment. This week in web technologies we started to learn about CSS and did some basic activities on stylesheets. In programming we were walked through the ternary operator and its uses. During maths we worked through worksheets about set theory and venn diagrams. During our business skills we were preparing for the interviews after half term.</p>
